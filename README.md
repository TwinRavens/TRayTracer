# TRayâš¡Tracer

TRayTracer is a purelly C++ RayTracer, using [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) to show the resulting image and processing with OpenGL's Compute Shaders. [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) is also used, as well as the [ASSIMP](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/) Library to import custom models. 

Solution for Visual Studio 2017, outputs everything on the BIN folder under TRayTracer's Project folder.

A GPU with openGL 4.3 is needed for it to work.
