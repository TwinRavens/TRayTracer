# TRayâš¡Tracer

TRayTracer is a purelly C++ RayTracer, using GLFW to show the resulting image and processing with OpenGL's Compute Shaders. GLEW is also used, as well as the ASSIMP Library to import custom models. Solution for Visual Studio 2017, outputs everything on the BIN folder under TRayTracer's Project folder. Developed by me and Luiz Augusto Wendt (@lawendt).
